# WS-NEMO: A weakly-supervised transformer-based wildfire smoke detection model

# Note
Most of the existing codebase's functionality will be untouched. Most and/or all of the configuration fields will be tweaked to fit the problem domain of wildfire smoke detection. There are countless possible configurations for the model which will require a large amount of experimentation to get the adapted model working correctly.

# Future Implementations
A graphical user interface (GUI) is planned to improve the usability of the model for both non-research oriented and research oriented parties.
